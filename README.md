## Introduction: Overview of Linear and Logistic Regression.
### Linear Regression
• Purpose: Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical outcomes. Its goal is to model the relationship between one or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

• Types: Simple Linear Regression that uses one independent variable and Multiple Linear Regression that uses more than one independent variable.

• Goal: To minimize the sum of squared residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) to find the best-fitting line, typically using methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

• Applications: Linear regression is used to predict housing prices based on features like size, location, and amenities and also to estimate stock prices based on market variables.

• Assumptions: Linearity between independent and dependent variables, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of residuals.

### Logistic Regression
• Purpose: Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no, true or false). Unlike linear regression, it predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a particular class.

• Decision Boundary: By default, probabilities greater than 0.5 are classified as 1, and those below 0.5 as 0.

• Types: Binary Logistic Regression that predicts between two classes (0 or 1), Multinomial Logistic Regression that extend for more than two classes, and Ordinal Logistic Regression that predicts ordered outcomes.

• Goal: It's goal is to find the best parameters to maximize the likelihood of correctly classifying observations, typically using methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

• Applications: Predicting whether a customer will purchase a product (yes/no) or for medical diagnosis (e.g., disease present or not) is the application of logistic regression.

• Assumptions: Independence of observations, linearity of independent variables and log-odds, and large sample size (for reliable results).
